        <div class="about-me-body">
            <p>Throughout my career in the food and beverage industry, I had the opportunity to work in various roles and gain valuable experiences. However, it was during the pandemic in 2020, following the birth of our first child, that I began to question the path I was on. The challenges and uncertainties brought about by the global crisis made me reevaluate my priorities and long-term aspirations.</p>

            <p>It was during this time that I discovered my passion for coding and technology. With a desire for a better work-life balance and more time to spend with my growing family, I embarked on a journey to learn how to code. The pandemic provided me with a unique opportunity to dive into online learning resources and dedicate myself to mastering programming languages and development concepts.</p>

            <p>As I delved deeper into coding, I found immense satisfaction in the problem-solving nature of programming and the limitless possibilities that the tech industry offers. The idea of being able to create something tangible and impactful while also having the flexibility to balance my personal and professional life resonated deeply with me.</p>
              
            <p>Now, armed with a solid foundation in coding and a burning passion for the field, I am determined to transition into the tech industry. I am excited to leverage my previous experiences in a new realm, bringing a fresh perspective, adaptability, and a strong work ethic. My journey from the food and beverage industry to pursuing a career in tech is driven by a deep-rooted desire for personal and professional growth, along with the pursuit of a fulfilling and balanced lifestyle for myself and my family.</p>
